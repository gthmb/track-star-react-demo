## Commits

I'll do my best to walk through building the app together in class. The commit history follows the sections of the walkthrough pretty well.

## Online demo

There is a running version of this application online here: https://quirky-booth-4581c0.netlify.app. The API has been deplpoyed to [Heroku](https://track-star-api.herokuapp.com/), and should be available. It's hosted on the free tier, so it may sleep and and be brefily unavailable.
